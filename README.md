# SwiftUIAnimationLab

A collection of interactive SwiftUI demos exploring animation techniques, including path morphing and scroll-based effects.

## Features

- 📐 **Path Morphing**: Smoothly animate between an ellipse and a diamond shape using custom `Shape` and `animatableData`.
- 🌞 **Scroll Effects**: Scroll-driven rotation and fading of views using `GeometryReader`.

## Getting Started

1. Open the project in **Xcode 15 or later**.
2. Run on an iOS simulator or device.
3. Navigate through the demos to explore different animation techniques.

## Demos

- `ScrollEffectsDemo.swift` – Demonstrates scroll-dependent UI behavior.
- `PathMorphingDemo.swift` – Showcases custom shape interpolation using SwiftUI’s animation system.
